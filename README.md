# 🏠 Property Listing App (Expo Project)
This is my first project built using Expo and React Native. I created this app as part of a technical assessment to demonstrate my ability to build a maintainable and scalable mobile app using Expo and TypeScript.

Build a property listing app with a focus on:

- Clean and maintainable code  
- Good UI/UX  
- API integration  
- State management  
- Navigation  

## 📱 Features

- Built with **Expo** and **TypeScript**  
- Navigation handled by **expo-router**  
- Styling using **nativewind / twrnc**  
- API integrated via **React Query**  
- State management with **zustand** and **jotai**  
- Home screen: searchable list of properties  
- Property detail screen: map and feature list  
- Booking properties and viewing bookings  
- Bottom tab navigation: Home, Bookings, Profile
